# LaunchControl
## Get rid of nasty start up applications on Mac OS X
Whenever I restart my mac every few weeks I notice a huuuuge amount of applications which start up and idle in the background. Once you struggled with editing the launch agents by yourself you've noticed how much work it is to clean your system from all the junk. 
LaunchControl tries to make enabling disabling and viewing launch agents easy. 

## About
LaunchControl is a command line application which allows you to edit various startup items on your mac without leaving the terminal.
Not only does it disable/enable startup items, it allows you to edit specific launch parameters.

It does bundle an interactive cli application as well as a handy library to parse launchagents with ease.
Build with love and ruby.

## Dependencies
You need ruby and bundler. Basically pre-installed on MacOS X.

## Installation
Run `bundle install` to install required dependencies. 
**DO NOTE** Some launch agents require sudo privileges so make sure you've installed the dependencies for the root user as well.

## Instructions
To get a list of all launch agents type: 
`ruby launchcontrol.rb list`

To disable/enable a launch agent type:
`ruby launchcontrol.rb enable <launch-agent-id>`
`ruby launchcontrol.rb disable <launch-agent-id>`

For other instructions refer to:
`ruby launchcontrol.rb help`

## Documentation
The yard doc is bundled within the repository. I'll add an online mirror as soon as possible.
